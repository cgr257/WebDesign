You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! But you are dressed as one... You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! Who's that then?</p></div>

<p>No, just a regular mistake. Bender, this is Fry's decision&hellip; and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. I love you, buddy!</p></div>

I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. You mean it controls your actions? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.</p>
<p>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide. You don't believe in the Force, do you? The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</p></div>
